			sudo.create crafts cinematic stories and the systems that keep them
			alive. film, photo, and sound are the instruments; strategy and
			workflows are the score. We design for feeling first, then make it
			repeatable — assets and processes that actually work for your team.

	<div class="collapse-title font-semibold">Do you do photo and video?</div>
	<div class="collapse-content text-sm">
		yes. we produce cinematic photo and film when it serves the story —
		planned production days, templated deliverables, and tagged assets so
		nothing gets lost in the edit. every frame has a job. every asset earns
		its place. (coffee encouraged.)

			infrastructure for your art — empowering, not bureaucratic. clean

		<p class="mt-2">
			no fluff. no filler. just craft, clear deliverables, and workflows
			that let your story breathe — and keep breathing.
