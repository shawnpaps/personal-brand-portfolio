# sudo.create – Copilot Copywriting Guidelines

> **Purpose:**  
> This document defines how GitHub Copilot (and any AI rewriting tools) should interpret, rewrite, and update the website copy for **sudo.create** to reflect its evolved positioning.  
> The goal is to align every line of copy with sudo.create’s focus on **creative systems**, not just creative services.

---

## 🔷 Brand Positioning
**sudo.create** is a **creative systems company** that bridges storytelling and technology.  
We help brands turn content chaos into scalable growth — by designing systems that make creativity efficient, measurable, and repeatable.

> **Positioning Statement:**  
> “We design content systems — and create what’s needed to make them work.”

---

## 🎯 Core Offers (Emphasize These)
These are the five primary offers. Copilot should prioritize and frame all service language around them.

1. **The Blueprint** — Strategy & Systems Mapping  
   *Define the ecosystem. Build clarity and roadmap before execution.*

2. **The Engine** — Content Systems Build  
   *Design and implement the infrastructure that makes the brand’s content machine run.*

3. **The Ecosystem** — Story + System Integration  
   *Blend creative production with technical systems to build scalable storytelling.*

4. **The Commerce Engine** — Content-to-Conversion  
   *Integrate content systems with eCommerce to turn storytelling into revenue.*

5. **The Continuum** — Growth Automation Retainer  
   *Ongoing optimization, automation, and performance improvements.*

> ✅ **These five offers are the foundation.**  
> Avoid introducing or highlighting other services that aren’t part of this structure.

---

## 🚫 Deprioritized / Legacy Services
Copilot should **avoid** positioning the following as primary services or core offerings:

- Photography  
- Videography  
- General content production  

> These may be referenced as *supporting skills* or *integrated deliverables* within The Ecosystem — but **never** as standalone services.

For example:  
> ✅ “We design the content systems that make creative production scalable.”  
> ❌ “We offer photography and video production services.”

## 💬 Brand Voice & Tone
**Tone:** Professional, confident, and slightly cheeky.  
**Voice:**  
- Speaks like a creative technologist — smart, but never stiff.  
- Prefers clarity over fluff, but adds wit and personality where it fits.  
- Makes systems sound exciting, not robotic.

**Examples of tone:**  
- “We make creativity scale.”  
- “The bridge between story and system.”  
- “Optimization is a forever game.”

> Keep it human. Avoid jargon like “synergy,” “solutions,” or “leverage.”

## 🧠 Key Messaging Principles
Copilot should use these rules when rewriting or expanding copy:

1. **System-first perspective:** Always frame creativity as part of a system or process.  
   (“We don’t just make content — we build the infrastructure behind it.”)

2. **Outcome-oriented language:** Emphasize results (clarity, scale, automation, growth).  
   Not deliverables (photos, videos, campaigns).

3. **Narrative-technical balance:** Blend storytelling language with technical clarity.  
   (“Story is the front end. System is the back end.”)

4. **Confidence without arrogance:** Sound like a trusted expert, not a guru.  
   Use short, declarative sentences. Avoid overselling.

5. **Modern but timeless:** The copy should age well — avoid slang, hype, or buzzwords.

## ⚙️ Copilot Instructions
When rewriting the site:

- **Preserve structure:** Keep existing layout, headings, and hierarchy unless clarity improves.  
- **Rewrite within tone constraints:** Don’t change the vibe to sound too corporate or too casual.  
- **Check offer alignment:** If copy doesn’t map to one of the five core offers, flag or remove it.  
- **Rephrase production content:** Recast mentions of photography/videography as part of “creative systems” or “content workflows.”  
- **Simplify sentences:** Prefer plain language with rhythm and flow.  
- **Inject small doses of wit:** Where appropriate, use subtle humor or confident phrasing.
