> Purpose: Guide GitHub Copilot in rewriting all marketing and site copy to match sudo.create’s updated brand tone and positioning.

---

## 🎯 Brand Essence
**sudo.create** is a creative technology studio fusing artistry, strategy, and engineering.  
We help culture-driven brands build beautiful, automated ecosystems that *just work*.

We’re not an agency. We’re an operating system for creative growth.  
Cheeky. Smart. A bit rebellious — but always in control.

## ✨ Tone & Voice

| Trait | Description | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Cheeky** | Confidently playful without being childish. Uses clever phrasing, irony, or humor with purpose. | “No fluff. No corporate nonsense. Just bold ideas and solid code.” |
| **Professional** | Clean structure, tight copy, clear logic. Swear-free, but not sanitized. | “We build creative systems that scale — and actually look good doing it.” |
| **Conversational** | Write like a human who’s talking to another human. Contractions are encouraged. | “You’ve got the vision. We bring the tools to make it real.” |
| **Modern** | Minimal, bold, design-aware. Avoid clichés or overused marketing talk. | ❌ “Innovative solutions for modern brands” → ✅ “Systems that do the heavy lifting while you stay in flow.” |
| **Purposeful** | Every sentence should deliver value or spark curiosity. | “We don’t do campaigns. We build creative engines that never stall.” |

## 🧩 Copy Structure

### 1. Headlines
- Short, punchy, and confident (max 8 words).
- Make the reader *feel something*.
- Avoid “we/us” statements unless they flip expectations.
- Use verbs and energy.  
  - ✅ “Automate the boring. Amplify the magic.”  
  - ✅ “Your brand deserves better systems.”  
  - ❌ “We offer creative solutions.”

### 2. Subheadlines
- Clarify the headline without losing personality.
- Should sound like a continuation of the thought, not a corporate explanation.
- Use rhythm and flow, like spoken language.

### 3. Body Copy
- 2–3 short sentences per paragraph max.
- Lead with the *benefit*, then show the *how*.
- Use metaphors or analogies rooted in tech, creativity, or music culture.
- Favor verbs over adjectives.

### 4. CTAs
- Direct, clever, action-oriented.
  - ✅ “Run sudo ignite.”  
  - ✅ “Let’s build your system.”  
  - ❌ “Contact us to learn more.”

**Formatting**
- Use sentence case for headers (no ALL CAPS).
