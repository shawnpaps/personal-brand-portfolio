## ✨ Voice & Tone

| Trait | Description | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Cinematic** | Think in shots, light, and rhythm. Every line should feel like a frame in motion. | “Light cuts through shadow. The story begins.” |
| **Emotional** | Write from the gut — evoke feeling before function. | “Stories that stay with you long after the screen fades.” |
| **Playful Confidence** | We’re pros who don’t take ourselves too seriously. | “We direct, shoot, and edit like we mean it.” |
| **Human & Poetic** | Speak with clarity, warmth, and artistry. | “Cameras don’t tell stories — people do.” |
| **Refined Realness** | Polished, but not pretentious. Beautifully minimal, like great composition. | “Every frame matters. Every detail earns its place.” |
